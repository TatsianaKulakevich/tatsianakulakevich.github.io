My name is Tatsiana Kulakevich, I am a U.S. Fulbright Scholar and Associate Professor of Instruction in the School of Interdisciplinary Global Studies at the University of South Florida (USF). I serve as a Research Fellow and Affiliate Faculty member at USF’s Institute for Russian, European, and Eurasian Studies. 

My research examines how opposition, identity, and institutions evolve under pressure and repression, with extensions into international security, comparative politics, and migration/diaspora politics. I also maintain interests in statistical methodology and applied game theory.

My analyses appeared in media and academic journals, including [The Hill](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/5404093-belarus-emerges-from-western-isolation-but-the-opposition-is-still-fighting/), [The Washington Post (TMC) ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/09/14/belarus-russia-ukraine-putin-lukashenko/?fbclid=IwAR0tdXJEvVpoA3hPYY9eBU0FV-Qatx8M_aKy2hhiKhvOFfHvO2-mWgq-agU), [U.S. News and World Report](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2024-11-11/could-trump-turn-out-to-be-great-for-ukraine), [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/3-reasons-why-a-trump-white-house-might-not-be-a-disaster-for-ukraine-in-fact-it-might-tighten-the-screws-on-russia-243227), [The Good Authority (formerly TMC)](https://goodauthority.org/news/the-us-belarus-prisoners-for-potash-deal-explained/?fbclid=IwY2xjawOujEVleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETFmNFNjTHlsTDBTV1NnTDFUc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHpaIZrZGma9HZsyaeOlm8pKTIZ7JxcFKqYmuWvoHTYuMWC8Oj7etGUK7CyXa_aem_qxxR_p4c8fPNRPlaPKe-xw), [The Globe Post](https://theglobepost.com/2019/02/06/belarus-russia-it/), [The New Eastern Europe](https://neweasterneurope.eu/2021/03/09/russia-is-jailing-the-opposition-a-good-way-to-win/), [SAIS Review](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/783885), [East European Politics and Societies: and Cultures](http://eep.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/06/16/0888325414535429.abstract), [Nationalities Papers](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/nationalities-papers/article/antiauthoritarian-learning-prospects-for-democratization-in-belarus-based-on-a-study-of-polish-solidarity/0B05C923250A86C3E8AAB7E27F3542FA), [International Migration](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/imig.12881), and [Canadian Slavonic Papers](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00085006.2021.1991744).
