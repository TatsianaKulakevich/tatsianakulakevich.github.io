My Name is Tatsiana Kulakevich, and I am a U.S. Fulbright Scholar and Associate Professor of Instruction in the School of Interdisciplinary Global Studies at the University of South Florida, and I serve as Research Fellow and Affiliate Faculty at the Institute for Russian, European and Eurasian Studies.

My work centers on European politics, with a regional emphasis on Eastern Europe. I examine how democracies adapt under pressure and how authoritarian regimes respond to those same challenges, situating these dynamics within broader questions of international security and political stability. I also maintain interests in statistical methodology and applied game theory.

My analyses appeared in media and academic journals, including [The Hill](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/5404093-belarus-emerges-from-western-isolation-but-the-opposition-is-still-fighting/), [The Monkey Cage - Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/09/14/belarus-russia-ukraine-putin-lukashenko/?fbclid=IwAR0tdXJEvVpoA3hPYY9eBU0FV-Qatx8M_aKy2hhiKhvOFfHvO2-mWgq-agU), [U.S. News and World Report](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2024-11-11/could-trump-turn-out-to-be-great-for-ukraine), [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/3-reasons-why-a-trump-white-house-might-not-be-a-disaster-for-ukraine-in-fact-it-might-tighten-the-screws-on-russia-243227), [The Globe Post](https://theglobepost.com/2019/02/06/belarus-russia-it/), [The New Eastern Europe](https://neweasterneurope.eu/2021/03/09/russia-is-jailing-the-opposition-a-good-way-to-win/), [SAIS Review](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/783885), [East European Politics and Societies: and Cultures](http://eep.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/06/16/0888325414535429.abstract), [Nationalities Papers](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/nationalities-papers/article/antiauthoritarian-learning-prospects-for-democratization-in-belarus-based-on-a-study-of-polish-solidarity/0B05C923250A86C3E8AAB7E27F3542FA), [International Migration](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/imig.12881), and [Canadian Slavonic Papers](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00085006.2021.1991744).
