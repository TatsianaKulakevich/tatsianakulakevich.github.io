My Name is Tatsiana Kulakevich, and I am an Associate Professor of Instruction in the School of Interdisciplinary Global Studies, Research Fellow and Affiliate Faculty at the Institute for Russian, European and Eurasian Studies at the University of South Florida.

M work centers on European politics, with a regional emphasis on Eastern Europe. I examine how democracies adapt under pressure and how authoritarian regimes respond to those same challenges, situating these dynamics within broader questions of security and political stability. I also maintain interests in statistical methodology and applied game theory.

My analyses appeared in media and academic journals, including [The Hill](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/5404093-belarus-emerges-from-western-isolation-but-the-opposition-is-still-fighting/), [The Monkey Cage - Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/09/14/belarus-russia-ukraine-putin-lukashenko/?fbclid=IwAR0tdXJEvVpoA3hPYY9eBU0FV-Qatx8M_aKy2hhiKhvOFfHvO2-mWgq-agU), [U.S. News and World Report](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2024-11-11/could-trump-turn-out-to-be-great-for-ukraine), [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/3-reasons-why-a-trump-white-house-might-not-be-a-disaster-for-ukraine-in-fact-it-might-tighten-the-screws-on-russia-243227), [The Globe Post](https://theglobepost.com/2019/02/06/belarus-russia-it/), [The New Eastern Europe](https://neweasterneurope.eu/2021/03/09/russia-is-jailing-the-opposition-a-good-way-to-win/), [SAIS Review](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/783885), [East European Politics and Societies: and Cultures](http://eep.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/06/16/0888325414535429.abstract), [Nationalities Papers](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/nationalities-papers/article/antiauthoritarian-learning-prospects-for-democratization-in-belarus-based-on-a-study-of-polish-solidarity/0B05C923250A86C3E8AAB7E27F3542FA), [International Migration](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/imig.12881), and [Canadian Slavonic Papers](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00085006.2021.1991744).
